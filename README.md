# Analyzing your Google searches

The full step-by-step can be found in [the original blogpost](https://perplex.city/the-search-for-self-60e2149cffa3#.oqeazto3n). The blogpost relies on Gists, but [a complete Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/WalkerHarrison/Google_searches/blob/master/google_searches.ipynb) is also available. Email me at hello@perplex.city with any questions.

UPDATE: this blog was cross-posted on dev.to, and the code cleaned up and simplified a bit. So, those of you who want to give it a shot should now [consult this notebook]((https://github.com/WalkerHarrison/Google_searches/blob/master/google_searches_417.ipynb))
